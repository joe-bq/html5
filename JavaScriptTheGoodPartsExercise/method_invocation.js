/* here in this program we will discuss some of the common function invocation patterns *


/* the invocation pattern can be divided into the following categories and sets

* Method invocation Pattern 
* Function invocation pattern
* Constructor invocation pattern
* Apply Invocation Pattern

You can analogy the "Method Invocation Pattern" to the instance method - by which the "this" is bound to the instance itself.

the Function invocation pattern is like the static method, normally in OO language, in static function, it won't have a "this" binding, but in Javascript, the "this" still refers to "the global object - or the global scope"

Constructor can also be analogy to the method invocation, can you can find its counterparty int the OO language world. the difference between the "method invocation " and "constructor"

the apply invocation is the most dynamic and is the template of all the method invocation that we have introduced above.
