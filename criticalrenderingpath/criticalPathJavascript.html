Conclusion:
1.     executing our inline script blocks DOM construction, which will also delay the initial render.
2.     the browser will delay script execution until it has finished downloading and constructing the CSSOM, and while weâ€™re waiting, the DOM construction is also blocked!

and the official notes on the rendering from : https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/adding-interactivity-with-javascript

01 location of the script in the document is significant.
02 DOM construction is paused when a script tag is encountered and until the script has finished executing.
03 JavaScript can query and modify the DOM and CSSOM.
03 JavaScript execution is delayed until the CSSOM is ready.
